# Udacity_SageMaker_Deployment

O.K.  There is a TON of good information in here.  I actually create a model and deploy it on AWS using AWS SageMaker.  At the end, I have an HTML page that asks you to input a movie review.  I automatically take that text input and feed it to my model on an AWS server in the cloud, assess if your input is Positive or Negative, then send that assessment back out to the HTML page for your feedback.

The jupyter notebook sample code can be found here [SageMaker Project.ipynb](https://github.com/the-john/Udacity_SageMaker_Deployment/blob/master/SageMaker%20Project.ipynb).  There is an HTML version here [SageMaker Project.html](https://github.com/the-john/Udacity_SageMaker_Deployment/blob/master/SageMaker%20Project.html).


I did a couple of "fake" reviews myself on the web page and took a snap shot of the feedback from the model.


This is what happened when I input a Positive Review.

This is what happened when I input a Negative Review.

Probably the key thing I learned in all of this effort is that I have a LOT more to learn about how to exploit the power of the Cloud.  One thing I'm currently struggling with is where do I invest my efforts;  Amazon, Google, Microsoft.  Still on the fence with this one.  So much to learn, so little time ...
